## Description: 
We will be creating an app that provides you with the capability to connect with people who attend your university, requiring them to have a @colroado.edu email address to sign up. We will create a user fiendly UI, usable only through mobile devices, creating simplicity for the user. We will make it easy for you to interact with your friends and make new ones along the way.

## Vision Statement:
We envision a world were interconnectivity is in the palm of your hand. The constantly changing realm of social networks has become an integral part of our lives, and we strive to create the network that interacts with everything and that will move us towards a more connected world.

## Motivation:
- As you adults we like to have our social circle all in one place
- We like to easily connect with our friends and peers
-	We like to be distracted from our day today
-	We want to be able to share knowledge and ideas with others at our university
- It isnt always easy to connect with someone in person because of the regular day to day of our busy schedules as a student
- It isn't always easy to make friends on your campus, we want to be able to make friends fast and within our interest

## Risks:
- We will use Android system for this App. So far just one group member is familiar with it. Others of us need study it by ourselves.
- We have some experience about this the similar App or website, like Tinder or facebook. But we think that’s not enough. We want to do some better.
- We need some special information. For example, we need to collect some social information in the special, just like CU Boulder students information(e.g. email address, daily news and so on)  

## Mitigation Strategy For Dealing With Risk:
1.	We need to study how to use Android system. And we need more group meeting to talk about the problem we meet.
2.	We can talk with our TA, try to look for some more information we can help us.

## User Stories:
1.	Create UI Shell: “As a student, I want to be able to quickly navigate the social circle in my area so that I can interact with my friends and make new friends near me.” (Story Points: 8)
2.	Develop a Profile Database: “As a user, I want to be able to see my friend’s profiles with information about themselves so that I can learn more about people in my social group.” (Story Points: 5)
3.	Create Personal Profiles: “As a student I want to be able to personalize my profile with information about myself so that people can learn more about me and I can meet new people.” (Story Points: 5)
4. Create private messaging: "As a college student I want to be able to message easily so that I can communicate with my friends." (Story Points: 8)
5. Friend Feed："As a students, I want to know what my close classmates are doing, so I can easily interact with my freinds on assignments." (Story Points: 8)
6.	Location: “As a university student I want to be able to see what sorts of things there are to do nearby (i.e. food, bars, events, etc.) so I can build a sense of community in my college town.” (Story Points: 5)
